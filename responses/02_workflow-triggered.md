## Look ðŸ‘€ at you!

Super awesome job so far!

Do you remember what our workflow trigger was?

```yaml
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened]
```

This means that every time an issue get's opened in this repository the GitHub Script you wrote will execute.

You should expect to see the result right here in this issue!

I'll respond in this issue after your workflow runs!

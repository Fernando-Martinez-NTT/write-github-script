## You have triggered a workflow!

Great job @{{user.login}}, you successfully added a workflow to this repository ðŸŽ‰! Adding that file to this branch is enough for GitHub Actions to begin running. The time this takes will vary based on the complexity of the workflow.

At this point we can ignore the workflow because it doesn't do anything yet ðŸ˜¢, but we will be modifying it many times to explore using GitHub Script.

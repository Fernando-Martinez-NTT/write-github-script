[GitHub Script](https://github.com/actions/github-script) is a special action that allows using [octokit/rest.js](https://octokit.github.io/rest.js/v17) directly in a workflow file.

Over the duration of this course you will learn the skills needed to begin using the GitHub Script action to interact with your repository which will save you from creating full blown actions that carry unnecessary overhead.

## What you'll learn

In this course you will learn how to:

- Use GitHub Script in your workflow
- Comment on issues using octokit
- Add issues to a project board using octokit
- Use the workflow expression syntax to filter when jobs run in a workflow.

## What you'll build

![A user opens an issue, the GitHub Actions bot responds with a welcome message. Another window shows that the issue has been added to a project board.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16547949/78669798-cf8b2e80-78aa-11ea-885e-65e72fa22379.png)

In this course you will automatically generate a comment on every new issue using a templated response. Additionally, if this issue is labeled as a bug it will be automatically added to the "needs triage" column of a project board.
